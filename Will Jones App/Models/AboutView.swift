I am a decorated ceremonialist in the Order of the Arrow having won honors on the Lodge, Section, and National levels.\n\nI also graduated Summa Cum Laude from University of Mary Washington with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, with a minor in Cybersecurity, in May 2020.\n\nIn my free time I love being outdoors, whether that is going hiking, camping, canoeing, kayaking, biking or any other outdoor realated activity. Other things I enjoy doing in my free time include: playing the guitar (electric, acoustic, and classical), playing video games, and sports. I mostly play basketball; however, I also play other sports as well for recreation and fun."
